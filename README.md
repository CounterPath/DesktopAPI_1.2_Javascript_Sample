The Bria Desktop API allows third-party applications to control Bria for Windows and Bria for Mac softphone clients. By leveraging the Application API, third-party applications can perform commands such as starting an audio or video call, answering a call or placing a call on hold.

The Bria for Desktop API was originally used by CounterPath in conjunction with a Microsoft Outlook® Add-In, to enable Bria calls to be placed from within the Outlook® application. It has therefore been “hardened” for commercial use.

CounterPath is now encouraging third-party-application developers to integrate their applications with Bria. Suggested applications range from simple functions such as enabling click-to-call from web pages, to integration with sophisticated Call Center, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Health Care applications.

This project provides sample and convenient wrapper code to utilize this API. *Note* you need a Bria desktop (Version 4.8 or higher, 5.X recommended) application to utilize the API.
