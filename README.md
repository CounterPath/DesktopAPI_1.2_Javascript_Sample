The Bria Desktop API allows third-party applications to control Bria for Windows and Bria for Mac softphone clients. By leveraging the Application API, third-party applications can perform commands such as starting an audio or video call, answering a call or placing a call on hold.

The Bria for Desktop API was originally used by CounterPath in conjunction with a Microsoft Outlook® Add-In, to enable Bria calls to be placed from within the Outlook® application. It has therefore been “hardened” for commercial use.

CounterPath is now encouraging third-party-application developers to integrate their applications with Bria. Suggested applications range from simple functions such as enabling click-to-call from web pages, to integration with sophisticated Call Center, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Health Care applications.

This project provides sample and convenient wrapper code to utilize this API. *Note* you need a Bria desktop (Version 5.0 or higher, 5.3+ recommended) application to utilize the API.

This code is provided wihtout support.  We welcome user contributions and comments.  Should you have any issues or questions, create an issue in the project and we respond on a best efforts basis.
